# LangChainGPT2
 This is a project utilizing the HuggingFacePipeline to set up the connection between langchain and the HuggingFacePipeline so LangChain can chain prompts with HuggingFace LLM access. From langchain PrompptTemplate was imported which allowed prompt to be defined as prompt template, which including dictionaries such as question: {question} and the definition of the input variable being the question. RunnableSequence was then initialized to define the prompt chaining sequence itself, first being defined as prompt and last=llms that was defined earlier as the HuggingFacePipeline. Invoke was then used to finally ask the model its question and utilize the API from hugging face transformer access.
